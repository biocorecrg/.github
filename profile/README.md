## CRG's Biocore GitHub 

Welcome to the CRG Bioinformatics Core GitHub! We provide researchers with services of analyses of high-throughput sequencing (NGS, Nanopore, droplet-based) and other biomedical data, software/pipelines and database development, and bioinformatics training. We focus on delivering reproducible results using modern computational solutions (NextFlow, Cloud, Linux containers).
